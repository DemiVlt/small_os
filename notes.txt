* I really like the idea of having notes for this and really hope you follow
  along, Demivolt.
* It's probably a better idea to do more of build-your-own OS stuffs, actually.
    - Way more efficient.
* Maybe just write EC ideas? So no quizzes.

          learn it as you shall with BIOS.

        * Quiz yourself on target triples, the meaning of the term ABI, all the
          different fields of a custom target json and their meanings, the red
          zone, and SIMD.
